# Code Refactor Starter Code

A README file is a document that provides information about a project, including instructions on how to use it, the purpose of the project, and any other relevant details. Here are some tips on how to write a README file for an HTML and CSS document:

Include a brief description of the project: Start your README file with a short paragraph that describes the purpose of your project. Explain what the project does, who it is for, and why you created it.

Installation instructions: Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and run the project. Include any dependencies or prerequisites that need to be installed before the project can be used.

Usage instructions: Explain how to use the project. If your HTML and CSS document is a website, provide the URL where it can be accessed. If it is a standalone web page, explain how to open it in a web browser.

Credits: If you used any third-party resources in creating your HTML and CSS document, include a list of those resources and links to their websites. Give credit where credit is due.

License: If you are sharing your HTML and CSS document with others, include a license that specifies how the document can be used. There are several open-source licenses available that you can use, such as the MIT License or the Apache License.

Contact information: Include your contact information so that others can reach out to you if they have questions or feedback about your project. This can be an email address, a GitHub profile, or any other method of contact that you prefer.

Examples and screenshots: If possible, include examples and screenshots of your HTML and CSS document in action. This will help others understand what your project does and how it can be used.

Remember to keep your README file concise and easy to read. Use headers, bullet points, and other formatting tools to make the information easy to navigate.

Since an HTML document is simply a file that can be opened in a web browser, installation instructions for an HTML document are usually quite simple. Here are some basic steps you can include in your installation instructions:

Download the HTML file: Provide a link or instructions for downloading the HTML file. If the file is part of a larger project, make sure to provide instructions for downloading the entire project.

Save the HTML file to your computer: Once the file is downloaded, save it to a location on your computer where you can easily find it.

Open the HTML file in a web browser: Double-click the HTML file to open it in a web browser. Alternatively, you can right-click on the file and select "Open with" to choose the web browser you want to use.

That's it! Once the file is open in a web browser, you should be able to view the HTML document and any associated CSS and JavaScript files that are linked to it. If there are any additional steps or dependencies required to view the HTML document, make sure to include those in your installation instructions.
